- title: Foodsharing platform
  text: "Karrot is a sleek and user-friendly open source tool where people can coordinate pickups to save food from being wasted and to share it freely. It is used by many grassroots initiatives around the world and by Solikyl in Gothenburg, the one making most use of it. Solikyl has at least six regular pickups a week on Karrot, and a couple of tons of food are rescued and distributed every month through a system of community fridges. However, more work is needed on Karrot to help scale up the foodsaving projects using it."

Groups and organisations will register their projects in advance, so that we can match participants to something they can contribute to the most.

Important dates are:
* 1 February - Deadline for registering projects
* 24 February - Deadline for registering as participant

The projects will have three different themes:
* Sharing is caring: Collaborative economy, the commons and sustainable consumption.
* Power to the people: Democracy, participation and transparency.
* I like to move it: Sustainable transportation, travel and mobility.

The basic guidelines for the projects are:
1. The project should be about developing or using new technologies in order to promote an increased participation in social movements, non-profit associations, democratic political processes and civil society in general.
2. The results of the project should be made available to the public.

See you!
