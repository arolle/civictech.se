On the 19th of November, we're organising our first meetup in partnership with OpenHeroines!

[OpenHeroines](https://openheroines.org) is a global collective for everyone working in OpenGov and Civic Tech identifying as a woman.

During this meetup, we'll have two wonderful speakers (to be annonced soon!) who will tell us about their experience in Civic Tech.

We will also have a discussion about what civic tech means for each one of us, what are some inspiring initiatives in Sweden and all around the world and how we can make the Swedish ecosystem as inclusive as possible!

If you recently learnt about Civic Tech because of [Vinnova's funding](https://www.vinnova.se/en/calls-for-proposals/civic-tech/digital-services-for-2019-04507/), you are welcome! We have invited one of the funding managers so you can ask them any question.

This event is open to all but we hope to see as many women as possible! Please share it to anyone whom you know would be interested!

* 18:30 Presentations (speakers to be announced!)
