The project goal is to create a platform where citizens can debate about Riksdagens activity, talk to its commissioners and support the creation of proposals. The platform already exists https://www.dinriksdag.se and is based on Consul, the online platform that is used by the city of Madrid for participatory budgets, citizen proposals and other functions to strenghten the participation of citizens.

## Technical spec
For one we need to adapt the content and structure of the platform after Riksdagen and the Swedish context. To do this you do not need any programming skills, rather an intrerest in politics and democracy.

When it comes to the programming part we need to adapt the log in system so that you can create an account with your social security number and/or include constituencies so that you can ad your address and create content based on your constituency.
