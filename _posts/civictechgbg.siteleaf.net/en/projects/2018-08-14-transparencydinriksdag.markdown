  text: I work with Digidem Lab on the project Democratic Cities to implement Consul,
    the worlds biggest citizen platform. Meanwhile I work on a project called Din
    Riksdag that involves including citizens in lawdrafting processes. A part of the
    challenge is the lack of simple and structured data for these processes.

The Swedish government is writing a new action plan for Open Government Partnership. The Swedish Government Offices (Regeringskansliet) is creating assignments and proposals about open data for agencies but there is still a lot missing to achieve real politics for open data. Today the government pubishes all their proposals, investigations and similar documents as PDF:s and without API. The goal for this hack is to manually extract data from Regeringkansliets documents and create additional value (visualisations, integrations to other services) to show the government how important it is to open up the data for real.

## Desired skills
Data scientists, web developers and designers with experience in visualisation. The hack is short so we will not build anything big. Everyone who is interested in open data and transparency can join and we will adapt the work after the participants.
