Openki is a platform to create offline courses by suggesting courses that are needed, so that other people can chose to participate, be a lecturer or contribute with a venue. The course is then published on the platform and on a map.

What I want to explore is if this platform could be adapted to be used for campaign work, by making it possible to post things that need to change and what needs to be done.
