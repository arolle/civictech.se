Groups and organisations will register their projects in advance, so that we can match participants to something they can contribute to the most.

Important dates are:
* 1 February - Deadline for registering projects
* 24 February - Deadline for registering as participant

## Register a project
Do you have a project who want to do? Contact us to discuss the details, or register with [this form](https://digidemlab.typeform.com/to/Ko2mGm).

The projects will have three different themes:
* Sharing is caring: Collaborative economy, the commons and sustainable consumption.
* Power to the people: Democracy, participation and transparency.
* I like to move it: Sustainable transportation, travel and mobility.

The basic guidelines for the projects are:
1. The project should be about developing or using new technologies in order to promote an increased participation in social movements, non-profit associations, democratic political processes and civil society in general.
2. The results of the project should be made available to the public.

See you!
