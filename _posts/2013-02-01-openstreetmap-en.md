OpenStreetMap creates and supplies geographical information for example in the form of maps and structured databases, freely available to everyone who wants to make use of it. The project was started as most of the maps one can believe is free often has judicial or technical limits for what you can do with them. This limits private individuals or companies from using the information in a creative, productive or other unexpected way.
