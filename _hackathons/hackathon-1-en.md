Remember that the 24th of February is the deadline for registering as participant.

The basic guidelines for the projects are:
1. The project should be about developing or using new technologies in order to promote an increased participation in social movements, non-profit associations, democratic political processes and civil society in general.
2. The results of the project should be made available to the public.

We will hold a programming course for beginners before the event, more information about this is coming soon!

See you!
