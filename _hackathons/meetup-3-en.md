We invite you to a day of workshops on the theme integrity and anonymity, in cooperation with the organisation <a href="https://www.dfri.se/">DFRI</a>. The subject is more relevant than ever considering how micro-targeting is used to affect our view of the world and our opinions, that the swedish police are going to start using face recognition in their work and big corporations keep developing their ways of gathering information about us. When areas of surveillance are expanded, we need to expand our own understanding of the surveillance algorithms, as well as use, spread and develop tools to escape the traps we risk falling into.

No prior knowledge is needed to participate!

If you feel like you already know all or some of this, we would love for you to show up and share your knowledge where it’s needed. We welcome any level of knowledge, and those who have more are encouraged to share it with the rest! If you want to lead a workshop yourself: get in touch.

During the day we will put together tips of available tools and  other things for anyone who wants to learn more about integrity and anonoymity. 

We will provide fika and a chill atmosphere!
