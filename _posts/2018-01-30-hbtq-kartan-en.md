As a LGBTQ person it is hard to know where your safe spaces are, especially in a city you don't know. Where can you a gym with a gender neutral dressing room? Where can you meet like-minded people? Where can you go for a drink?

We want to create an interactive map of Gothenburg (or maybe Sweden?), where LGBTQ persons or allies can review places based on their accessibility for LGBTQ people. We think the this kind of service would be of great help for LGBTQ persons and others willing to make informed decisions about which places to support. We also hope to be able to create change by reviewing places that aren't accessible right now. We would also like to encourage those who actually care about accessibility for LGBTQ persons and to make it easier for everyone to make a change!
