VoteIT is the web tool to help you host your democratic and participatory meetings online. VoteIT keeps agenda, discussion, proposals and polls gathered in a sleek and simple interface. The participants choose their own facilitator or moderator for the meeting who keeps everything in order and sets up new agenda items or polls when the meeting needs them.

VoteIT is a free and open source project and is free to download from GitHub to run on your own server. The project began in 2009 when the Swedish gaming federation (Sverok) was granted the first of two â‚¬100 000 grants from the Swedish Inheritance Fund.
