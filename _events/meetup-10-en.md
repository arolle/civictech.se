On the 28th of november, we'll have a new Civic Tech meetup to close this fantastic year and prepare the coming one!

Since we're seeing a lot of newcomers to the civic tech community thanks to the opening of Vinnova's civic tech funding, this event will be generalistic as well, and leave ample space and time for people who want to present a project or find a partner!

Once again, we'll have two wonderful speakers! Kristofer will update us about the possible changes regarding open data in the Swedish law and how we can make it more ambitious!

After some lightning pitches (please contact us in advance if you want to pitch so we can ensure you'll have time), we'll have a discussion around the values that we want to promote and foster as the civic tech ecosystem grows in Sweden.

If you recently learnt about Civic Tech because of [Vinnova's funding](https://www.vinnova.se/en/calls-for-proposals/civic-tech/digital-services-for-2019-04507/), we have invited one of the funding managers so you can ask them any question.

## Program
* 18:00 Mingle
